Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

QUESTIONS
#Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
#Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
#Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary):
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

Prototype: def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):
key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

Prototype: def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):
key argument will be always a string
If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
You are not allowed to import any module
#Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2

Prototype: def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
Returns a new dictionary
You are not allowed to import any module
